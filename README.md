# Chakra-Algorithm Python implementation
Geometry based cryptography is a new and emerging approach in the field of cryptography. Geometric algorithms 
are always difficult to decrypt as compared to other traditional algorithms .It uses geometric shapes such as circles, 
ellipses, etc and perform geometric transformations on these figures to produce cipher text.

Chakra algorithm, for symmetric key cryptography, is used as the basis for this work with some modifications in it 
for better results. “Chakra” means a circle or a disc. It plays a key role in encryption of data. 

This repo contains chakra algorithm implementation using python.
